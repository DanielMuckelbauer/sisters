After all their adventures, the day of their final challenge had finally arrived.
They had to face their greatest enemy yet...
You have become strong indeed!
But not strong enough! There can only be one!
So, you are able to withstand my most basic moves...
Let's see how you handle...
PHASE TWO!
I see now that I have been too gentle with you.
I shall not make the same mistake again!
Defend yourselves!
Oh no! 
You have defeated me in my final form.
It seems your powers have outgrown even mine!
I'll have to go to my secret hideout in Regensburg and train.
I will have my revenge in Part 2!
Or when I visit maybe...
HUUUUUUUUI! Jippie! At least I can fly, and you can't! Haha!
After their spectacular and unlikely victory, the sisters left their swords behind and went on to travel the world
